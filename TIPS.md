- You can use `tab` to switch between 'tab's :)

- For those who use mihomo via `systemctl --user`, I haven't decided how to set this. Maybe I should make another item in configtab.

- About Windows support, I have **NO** plan to do so. If you want to use this on windows, go [upstream](https://github.com/JohanChane/clashtui) or DIY.
